# FaviHunter
> Favicons are small icons in modern web applications that could be very useful for us in our day-to-day hunting activities, especially when we combine these icons with modern search engines to find assets on the internet. 

> This project aims to help a security professional find assets on the internet using favicon hashes on search engines such as [FOFA](https://en.fofa.info/), [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), [Censys](https://search.censys.io/), [Zoomeye](https://www.zoomeye.org/), and [Criminal IP](https://www.criminalip.io/).
The program returns a table with the custom queries of each search engine and their shortened URL with the query applied.
